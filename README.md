# Python-Sudoko-Solver
This is a recursive sudoko solver I have written 2 years ago, as a project of an online python course.

## Methods used:

**1. printboard -** 
There are 2 functions for printing the sudoko board, one is for testing and the other is for printing "pretty"

**2. findzero - **
    This is a function that finds the indexes of empty cells (they are marked by 0 as 0 is a digit that is not used in sudoko)

**3. isValid -** 
    This is a function that checks if a cell is valid for the input in consideration, according to the sudoko game rules.
    
**4. solve -** 
    This is the main function, it solves the sudoko board.
